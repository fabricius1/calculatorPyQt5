# Build a calculator desktop app with Python and PyQt5


I had zero knowledge about how to work with PyQt5 before reading Leodanis Pozo Ramos' excellent tutorial **Python and PyQt: Building a GUI Desktop Calculator** , published at [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/). My sincere thanks to the author for all the effort he put into creating that tutorial and sharing his lessons, on the one hand, and the Real Python site for making this kind of great content available for free, on the other. 

As one can notice, the first commit in this repository reproduces Ramos' final code. I intend to build on top of his code to add some small new features to this nice calculator built entirely with Python so that, during this process, I can also learn more about such an interesting Python module that is PyQt5.
